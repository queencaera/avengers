                    <p>The Black Widow audience gets to see Yelena Belova in action before she and
                         Natasha Romanoff are reunited in an old safe house. The two spy sisters don't
                          exactly start talking about their lives right away. Instead, Natasha stealthily 
                          enters the building and tosses out this line to preface their scuffle. <br><br>

                        It's a Black Widow quote that's indicative of her wry sense of humor, something the
                         audience doesn't get to see a lot of since she's often in the middle of life and 
                         death situations. Natasha knows that after over a decade apart, she and Yelena 
                         aren't just going to hug and make up, especially when they're both trained to be 
                         lethal. It's an opening to a great fight sequence that eventually gets the two on 
                         the same side.</p>
